## Why

Generate identicons (pixelated avatars) on the client from usernames instead of fetching images from a server!

## Live Demo üéÆ

Play with the JavaScript version of Minidenticons [here](https://laurentpayot.github.io/minidenticons/).

## Collisions

You will always get the same identicon for a given username. But it is not impossible to have different usernames with the same identicon. That's a [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision).

Generated identicons are 5√ó5 pixels large with vertical symmetry, and can have 18 different hues for the same saturation and lightness.
This means there are 2‚ÅΩ¬≥Àü‚Åµ‚Åæ‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ18 = 589,824 different identicons possible, but actually much less because of the modulo-based algorithm used to get more colored pixels at the center of the identicon instead of having them scattered. So duplicate identicons are inevitable when using a lot of them. It shouldn‚Äôt matter as identicons should not be used solely to identify an user, and should always be coupled to a *unique* username üòâ

Tests results below show that you have roughly a 7% chance to generate a duplicate identicon when already using 1000 of them.
